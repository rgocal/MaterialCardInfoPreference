# MaterialCardInfoPreference
Inspired by Chromium Os and Parts of MIUI settings, The CardInfoPreference allows the developer to create a multi purpose preference that offers a Title, Summary, Action Button and Action List. This preference can be used as an informative instance or introduction or presenting the user to better options in a settings menu.
